Hello everyone! I am Onkar Ruikar. I majored in computer engineering. I have seven-plus years of experience in enterprise application development. Web technologies are interesting to me. Assembling and tinkering with electronic circuits are my hobbies. I'm always eager to try new stuff.

## How did you start using MDN?

I came across MDN while learning CSS. And I found that MDN has thorough documentation about everything in one place. Now it is my go-to place for information.

## What do you like about the website?

Things are explained in a reader-friendly manner. The accompanying sample code makes it easy to understand the concepts. With live examples on the same page, I can stay on that page and not lose focus while reading the related concepts.

## Why do you contribute?

I find it satisfying. Our industry relies heavily on open source, so I try to help in any way that I can. Also, it keeps my knowledge sharp. I find the MDN Web Docs team welcoming and very experienced. Here, I get to learn new stuff. This is the easiest place for anybody to start their open source journey!
