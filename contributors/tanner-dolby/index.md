Hi, I’m Tanner. I have a background in Mathematics and a passion for technology. I’ve been working as a Software Engineer for a little over one year and started contributing to open source about two years ago. I’m a self-taught programmer and love building things for the Web. Outside of contributing to open source, I like skateboarding, photography, and illustration.

## How did you start using MDN?

I started using MDN because I needed to look up documentation on a specific JavaScript array method. After quickly finding the Array.prototype.map reference with examples which helped me to solve my problem. It was shortly after this that I realized how incredibly valuable MDN Web Docs is for providing developers a reliable reference for documentation on web technologies. Ever since then, I’ve been using MDN Web Docs as the first place I look for web technology documentation.

## What do you like about the website?

I like many things about the MDN Web Docs site, to name a few:

- The search functionality is lightning fast and always provides the most relevant matches which helps me to quickly find a reference page.
- Overall styling and typography of the site is very user-friendly and the content is accessible which creates an enjoyable user experience.
- Everytime I visit a docs page, I know that I can trust the content is up-to-date and has been checked by contributors and project maintainers.

## Why do you contribute?

Contributions to MDN are important because it helps to provide a reliable and accessible
source of information on the Web for developers. MDN Web Docs being open source allows for
bugs to quickly be spotted by contributors and for feature requests to be readily prototyped. I continue to contribute to MDN because it’s a welcoming and exciting group of people who are passionate about helping build a better Web. Building in the open creates an environment that allows for contributors from all over the world to help make MDN a better resource and that is incredible.
